# 0x01. Lockboxes
# Must Know üìì
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Here‚Äôs a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

# Concepts Needed‚ú¥Ô∏è:
1. **Lists and List Manipulation:**
    * Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
    * [Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

2. **Graph Theory Basics:**
    * Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
    * [Graph Theory (Khan Academy)](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs)

3. **Algorithmic Complexity:**
    * Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
    * [Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/asymptotic-notation-and-analysis-based-on-input-size-of-algorithms/)

4. **Recursion:**
    * Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
    * [Recursion in Python (Real Python)](https://realpython.com/python-recursion/)

5. **Queue and Stack:**
    * Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
    * [Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-in-python/)

6. **Set Operations:**
    * Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
    * [Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets)

By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.

# Tasks üìÉ
## 0. Lockboxes: [0-lockboxes.py](0-lockboxes.py)
You have `n` number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from `0` to `n - 1` and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

* Prototype: `def canUnlockAll(boxes)`
* `boxes` is a list of lists
* A key with the same number as a box opens that box
* You can assume all keys will be positive integers
  * There can be keys that do not have boxes
* The first box `boxes[0]` is unlocked
* Return `True` if all boxes can be opened, else return `False`
```groovy
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$ cat main_0.py
#!/usr/bin/python3

canUnlockAll = __import__('0-lockboxes').canUnlockAll

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$
```
```groovy
carrie@ubuntu:~/0x01-lockboxes$ ./main_0.py

True
False

# REFERENCE üìö
## CODE IMPLEMENTATION üíª
```groovy
def canUnlockAll(boxes):
    """
     a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

    :param boxes:
    :return: True or False
    """
    if not boxes or type(boxes) is not list:
        return False

    unlocked = [0]
    for n in unlocked:
        for key in boxes[n]:
            if key not in unlocked and key < len(boxes):
                unlocked.append(key)
    if len(unlocked) == len(boxes):
        return True
    return False
```
## CODE EXPLANATION ‚úçÔ∏è
```groovy
The canUnlockAll function takes a list of lists (boxes) as input.
Each inner list represents a box and contains the indices of other boxes that can be unlocked using their keys.
The function uses a depth-first search algorithm to traverse the boxes and determine if all of them can be opened.

In the provided example, the first box is initially unlocked, and its key opens the second box.
The second box's key opens the third box, and so on.
Since all the boxes can be opened, the output is True.

In the second example, the keys in the boxes form a loop,
allowing access to all the boxes. Hence, the output is True.

In the third example, there is no way to open the fifth box because it doesn't have any keys.
Therefore, the output is False.
```
