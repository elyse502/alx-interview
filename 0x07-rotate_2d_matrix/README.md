# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix
For the “0. Rotate 2D Matrix” project, you are tasked with implementing an in-place algorithm to rotate an n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. This challenge requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation and in-place operations in Python. Below are the key concepts and resources that you need to grasp in order to successfully complete this project.

# Concepts Needed🗞️:
1. **Matrix Representation in Python:**
    * Understanding how 2D matrices are represented using lists of lists in Python.
    * Accessing and modifying elements in a 2D matrix.
2. **In-place Operations:**
    * Performing operations on data without creating a copy of the data structure.
    * The importance of minimizing space complexity by modifying the matrix in place.
3. **Matrix Transposition:**
    * Understanding the concept of transposing a matrix (swapping rows and columns).
    * Implementing matrix transposition as a step in the rotation process.
4. **Reversing Rows in a Matrix:**
    * Manipulating rows of a matrix by reversing their order as part of the rotation process.
5. **Nested Loops:**
    * Using nested loops to iterate through 2D data structures like matrices.
    * Modifying elements within nested loops to achieve the desired rotation.
