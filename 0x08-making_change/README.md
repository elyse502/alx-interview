# 0x08. Making Change
For the `‚Äú0. Change comes from within‚Äù` project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Below are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete this project successfully.

# Reference üìö
</div>

A coin system is said to be canonical if the number of coins given in change by the greedy algorithm is the same as the minimum possible number of coins. In other words, the greedy algorithm always yields the optimal solution for a canonical coin system.


For example, the US coin system (1, 5, 10, 25 cents) is canonical. If you need to make 36 cents in change, the greedy algorithm would choose one quarter (25 cents), one dime (10 cents), and one penny (1 cent), for a total of three coins. This is indeed the minimum number of coins that can make 36 cents.


A non-canonical coin system, on the other hand, is one where the greedy algorithm does not always yield the optimal solution.


For example, consider a coin system with coins of 1, 3, and 4. If you need to make 6 units in change, the greedy algorithm would choose one 4-unit coin and two 1-unit coins, for a total of three coins. However, the optimal solution is to use two 3-unit coins, for a total of two coins. So in this case, the greedy algorithm does not yield the optimal solution, and the coin system is non-canonical.


In general, whether a coin system is canonical or non-canonical depends on the specific denominations of the coins. If the denominations have the property that the greedy algorithm always yields the optimal solution, the system is canonical; otherwise, it's non-canonical.

Greedy algorithms and dynamic programming are two strategies for solving optimization problems. Here's when you might use each:

**Greedy Algorithm:** You can use a greedy algorithm when the problem has the "greedy property", which means that a global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum. Greedy algorithms are generally simpler and faster, but they don't always provide the optimal solution.

For example, in the coin change problem, if the coin denominations are canonical (like 1, 5, 10, 25 in the US), a greedy algorithm will provide the optimal solution. This is because the largest denomination coin is always part of the optimal solution, unless that coin's value is greater than the change needed.

**Dynamic Programming:** You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems and the optimal solution to the main problem depends on the optimal solution to its subproblems. Dynamic programming is typically used when the greedy approach does not provide an optimal solution.

For example, in the coin change problem, if the coin denominations are not canonical (like 1, 3, 4), a dynamic programming approach will provide the optimal solution. This is because the optimal solution may involve using fewer coins of a larger denomination in favor of more coins of a smaller denomination.

The greedy algorithm can fail in non-canonical coin systems because it always selects the largest denomination coin without considering the remaining coins. For example, if you have coins of denominations 1, 3, and 4, and you're trying to make change for 6, the greedy algorithm would choose two coins (4 and 1), but the optimal solution is to use two 3-coin.

So, to decide which approach to use, you need to consider whether the problem has the greedy property (i.e., whether choosing a local optimum at each step will lead to a global optimum). If it does, you can use a greedy algorithm. If not, you should use dynamic programming.

In the context of optimization problems, a local optimum is the best solution within a neighboring set of candidate solutions, while a global optimum is the best solution among all possible solutions.


**Local Optimum:**
In a problem space, a solution is said to be a local optimum if there are no other solutions in the immediate vicinity that are better. However, there might be better solutions elsewhere in the problem space. 


For example, if you're climbing a hill and you reach a peak, you're at a local optimum because you can't go any higher by just taking a single step in any direction. But there might be a taller peak elsewhere that you can't see from your current position.


**Global Optimum:**
A solution is a global optimum if it's the best possible solution out of all candidate solutions. 


Continuing the hill-climbing example, the highest peak in the entire range is the global optimum. No matter where you are in the range, there's no single step you can take that will get you to a higher point than the top of this peak.


In the context of the coin change problem, a local optimum would be the best solution that can be achieved by changing the next coin, while a global optimum would be the least possible total number of coins that can make up the given amount. The greedy algorithm always chooses the local optimum, while dynamic programming strives to find the global optimum.
