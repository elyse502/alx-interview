# 0x09. Island Perimeter
For the `“0. Island Perimeter”` project, you will need to apply your knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers. Understanding how to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions for perimeter calculation is crucial for this task.

# Concepts Needed🗞️:
1. **2D Arrays (Matrices):**

    * Accessing and iterating over elements in a 2D array.
    * Understanding how to navigate through adjacent cells (horizontally and vertically).

2. **Conditional Logic:**

    * Applying conditions to determine whether a cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

3. **Counting Techniques:**

    * Developing a method to count the edges that contribute to the island’s perimeter.

4. **Problem-Solving Strategies:**

    * Breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, such as identifying land cells and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

5. **Python Programming:**

    * Nested loops for iterating over grid cells.
    * Conditional statements to check the status of adjacent cells.
